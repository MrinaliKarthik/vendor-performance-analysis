## Data Overview

This project uses multiple vendor and inventory datasets to analyze vendor performance, purchasing efficiency, and inventory movement.

### Raw datasets (not stored in GitHub)

The following raw transactional datasets are excluded from this repository due to GitHub file size limits:

•⁠  ⁠⁠ sales.csv ⁠ (~1.48 GB): Line-level sales transaction data used to compute vendor revenue and turnover metrics.

These files were used locally during analysis and are referenced by the Python scripts in this repository.

### Raw datasets stored in GitHub

Smaller supporting datasets are included under ⁠ data/raw/ ⁠, such as:
•⁠  ⁠Vendor invoice summaries
•⁠  ⁠Inventory snapshots
•⁠  ⁠Purchase price reference tables
•  Purchases
